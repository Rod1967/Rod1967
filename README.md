- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Rod1967
I work at the digital department of the Strasbourg University (France). I participate in different open source projects but I am not an IT developer (sorry :) but I have some background.
In fact I collect the feed back experience from users to discuss with developers. More often it's little things that can be changed for a better experience. 
Hope I'll be of some help.
Rod
